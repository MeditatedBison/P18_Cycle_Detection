# This file tells Git which files to ignore.

# 1. Ignore build output
# We don't need to track the compiled program because anyone can build it
# from the source code using the Makefile.

*.o
*.out

# 2. Ignore common OS/Editor files
# These files are generated by the operating system or code editors and are
# not part of the project itself.
